Hey DevOps Community,

I recently dove deep into Azure Bastion and wanted to share what Iâ€™ve learned, in case anyone else is on a similar journey.

Azure Bastion is a solid solution for securing remote access to your VMs without exposing them directly to the internet.

But as with any tool, the value lies in knowing how to implement it effectively.

In my latest blog post, I cover:
- The fundamentals of Azure Bastion and how it can fit into your existing security architecture.
- Step-by-step guidance on setting up Bastion hosts using Infrastructure as Code with OpenTofu and Terragrunt.
- Best practices for optimizing performance, managing costs, and maintaining security compliance.

Iâ€™ve tried to make the content as practical and actionable as possibleâ€”no fluff, just what you need to get started or improve your existing setup.

Why should you care? Well, if youâ€™re responsible for managing cloud infrastructure, you know how critical it is to strike the right balance between security and accessibility.

Azure Bastion offers a way to do just that, and my goal is to provide a resource that helps you make the most of it.

Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences with Azure Bastionâ€”letâ€™s learn from each other. Thanks for taking the time to check it out!
